# ImageAnalysis_CWC_NanoSIMS

This series of files contains both functions written in R and a script (.Rmd file) that sources each of the functions and uses them to calculate Manders Overlap, Pearson and Spearman coefficients.

Test data for trying out the code are provided in the folder named 'TN_Aliz2_Pair4_Public/TN_Aliz2_Pair4_Revised/mat'. To access this data when you run the .Rmd file, change dataPath = "" to dataPath = "TN_Aliz2_Pair4_Public".
